 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This class is designed to work with the now-deprecated
 * SAX1 {@link Parser Parser} class.  SAX2 applications should use
 * {@link XMLReaderFactory XMLReaderFactory} instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>ParserFactory is not part of the platform-independent definition
 * of SAX; it is an additional convenience class designed
 * specifically for Java XML application writers.  SAX applications
 * can use the static methods in this class to allocate a SAX parser
 * dynamically at run-time based either on the value of the
 * `org.xml.sax.parser' system property or on a string containing the class
 * name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the application still requires an XML parser that
 * implements SAX1.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This class works with the deprecated
 *             {@link Parser Parser}
 *             interface.
 * @since SAX 1.0
 * @author David Megginson
 * @version 2.0.1 (sax2r2)
